    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Etornam and I'm a second year majoring in ITM. I'm originally from Ghana but I moved here when I was 4 and lived in Chicago practically all my life. In my free time I like to solve jigsaw puzzles and binge watch TV-Shows. At the moment I'm currently binging Love is Blind and rewatching Attack On Titan.</p>
    <h2>My Turtles</h2>
    <p>A little fun fact I have two turtles named Bobinna and TuTu. I'm not sure what their genders are and I won't be able to tell until they're about a year old but as of now Bobinna(formerly known as Bob by my brothers) is female and Tutu unfortunately is a male. They're only 7 months old at the moment but I'm hoping they're both female.</p>
